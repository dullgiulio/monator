# MONATOR

Monator aims to become a (fairly) complete set of monitoring tools for web services.

Currently it only implements a trivial HTTP status and content test.

The aim is to make several idependent agents that can generate a stream of monitoring
data that can be analysed by a specific agent.

Currently in alpha stage.
